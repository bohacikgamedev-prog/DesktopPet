# DesktopPet
Hey there!
Welcome to DesktopPet, my little fun project where a tiny pet lives on your desktop and keeps you company while you code, browse, or just procrastinate 😎.

What’s in here:
DesktopPetVS.sln – The Visual Studio solution.
DesktopPetVS/ – All the juicy stuff: source code (.cs), UI (.xaml), and assets (sprites, icons, sounds…).
latest_version.txt – Keeps track of the latest version.
README.md – Yup, that’s this file!

And don’t worry, the .exe build is in the Releases section if you just wanna run it without opening Visual Studio.

How to run:
Option 1 – Run from source code
Clone or download the whole repo:
git clone https://github.com/bohacikgamedev-prog/DesktopPet.git
Open DesktopPetVS.sln in Visual Studio.
Hit Run (F5) and watch your pet do its thing! 🐶🐱

Option 2 – Run just the DesktopPet folder and .sln
You don’t need the entire repo – you can download just the DesktopPetVS folder and the .sln file if you want.
Open the solution in Visual Studio and run it.

Option 3 – Run the .exe from Releases
Download the .exe file from Releases.
Windows Defender might warn you – just allow it.
A simple installer wizard will guide you through the installation.

Contributing
If you wanna add features, fix bugs, or just make the pet dance more, feel free to fork the repo and send a PR.
Don’t be shy, all contributions are welcome! 😁

Future plans
I’m actively working on this project, so expect updates and new features over time.
Right now it’s just the beginnings, but I’ll try to make it more fun and interactive.
